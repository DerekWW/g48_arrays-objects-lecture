// Arrays in JavaScript are containers that we can use to store
// different types of data in an ordered manner. Arrays are
// declared using square brackets like this [] and allow us to
// store many pieces of data in a single variable as a
// collection. Since arrays are in a specific order it means they can
// be rearranged, filtered, and sorted.

// Declaring a new, empty array and saving it to a variable.

var emptyArray = [ ];
console.log(emptyArray);

// We can store data in a array by simply putting it between
// the brackets.

var oneItem = [99];
// console.log(oneItem);

// We can create a array with multiple items by putting in
// multiple comma seperated values.

var moreItems = ['Squirtle', 4, false, oneItem, true];

// console.log(moreItems);
